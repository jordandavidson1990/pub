How similar was your plan to the final program? Did you have to digress from your plan as the program developed?
Does each of your classes follow the Single Responsibility principle? Or are any of your classes doing too much?
Did you practice TDD?
Are each of your methods tested? Did you find anything difficult to test?


Our final program kept close to the plan we drew up during the MVP sections. We started to venture off as we went through the
extensions. The class that didn't follow the Single Responsibility principle was the Pub class which had the majority of the functions by the end.
Pub was perhaps doing too much.

TDD was crucial as we could debug as we went. It enabled us to see where we were going wrong.

All of the methods are tested and passed.
